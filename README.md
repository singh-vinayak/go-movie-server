### The main branch contains code that's not using any external database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB). Instead, it utilises golang's inbuilt struct and array implementations.

## I've created different branches for different database implementations.

- mysql
- mongodb
- postgresql
- postgresql-with-gorm
